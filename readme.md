When I try to work on jianpu (aka [Numbered musical notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbered_musical_notation)), it turns out that Lilypond can't handle this.

After search the [mail-list](http://lilypond.1069038.n5.nabble.com/), I find some topics on it.

`Silas S. Brown` offered an non-lilypond way [Jianpu in Lilypond](http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/ssb22/mwrhome/jianpu-ly.html). But I don't like Silas's solution, beacuse I have to write script twice: one for jianpu, another for stave.

Fortunately, `Paul Morris` offered [another solution](http://lilypond.1069038.n5.nabble.com/Jianpu-Notation-tp174685p175857.html). That's what I want.

There are some bugs in `Paul Morris`'s code. And I try to fix them.

Since I know nothing about scheme, so the first step is STUDY SCHEME.

Hope I can change the code within a month.
